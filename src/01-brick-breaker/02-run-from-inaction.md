title: Run from Inaction

Another day where my mind weighed
Another day that my brain slayed
Can’t fight with what’s in the mirror
I failed to deliver

What’s this feeling that keeps bringing me down?
Tried so hard but it crumbled around me

I took it on it's a winner
It got me said I'm a sinner
Tried fighting always a failure
Can I get a fake yeah?
Asked my conscious what it thought I’d done
Played me over and it always won

Leave me, run from inaction
Stop me, run from inaction
Shock my body to get a reaction
Shock my brain to fight the attraction
Fight me, run from inaction
Why me, run from inaction
Hold this mind to complete the transaction
Help this ego to run from inaction

Another day without seeing life
Another day that my brain denied
“Get up don’t fall asleep again”
I’d try but I’m scared I’d still remain

## Meaning

Is there a battle going on in my head or am I just too lazy to take a look and see there’s just a few things that need attention? Things probably wouldn't take any effort at all compared to being paralysed by the fear that the unknown is there. I know exactly what needs doing but I’m scared to do it trapped in a perpetual loop of inaction.
