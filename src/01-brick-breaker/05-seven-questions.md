Here’s how it goes you can’t look back
It makes for policies you lack
Then you shake your head and ignore
This shit had all been said before

So if you dance, do you think you could laugh?
And if you try, could you have a nice time?

So one year on and have things changed?
You reckon shit is still the same
You too high up to make the call?
But mate you haven’t got the balls

So if you stay, do you think you could wait?
If you look back, does it change who you are?

Could you walk away from all you’ve seen
Write off the people that you’ve been
Did friendship mean that much to you at all?
Was she the last to ever know
Why you let her go

I tried to make you wait
But I couldn’t make you stay
Because you run away

I tried to make you stay
But you couldn’t face your mate
Because you run away
