Are we here again?
What have we done to start a fight
It’s Friday night
And I’m gonna Drink until this is alright

I’ve fucked you over I know what I’ve done
I said I was sorry so leave it alone
But you wanna duke this out again
There’s no way I’ll stop you my friend

We fight, because we're passionate
We cry, because we care too much

Did you ever stop to think this over?
Wait because I’m still not sober
Don’t remember signing up to you
We are just good friends but nothing more
Eject the tape and change the record
Take this life and turn it into two

Can we start again?
We’re running in circles either side
But it’s alright, with both of us
Waiting until we collide

Times getting older and we’re still too young
My mind lost its count of the pain and the fun
Let’s keep on playing silly games
I’ll play until I find my sane

We fight, because we're passionate
We cry, because we care too much

Did you ever stop to think this over?
Wait because I’m still not sober
Don’t remember signing up to you
We are just good friends but nothing more
Eject the tape and change the record
Take this life and turn it into two
