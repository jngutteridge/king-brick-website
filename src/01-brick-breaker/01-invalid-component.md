What would you do if I went insane?
Would you tie me up and play a game?
Would you mess me up and ascend my brain?
Would you boil my head and start again?

Let’s play a game where you’ve got my heart
Where you toy with it and you tear it apart
Where you want my soul but I won’t let it part
Where you play with me and I won’t let it stop

I can kill but I won’t show it
Does what that lives inside you own it?
Of this momentary way
Where the lives see what they say
Can you preach and live without it
Show around the guy you love it
You’re just lost inside the moment
It’s just an invalid component

Let’s just live inside our brains
Keep on playing silly games
Let’s just find ourselves our rights
Live it full cause it’s our lives

If I say it one more time
Don’t believe my silly lies
Let’s just get outside our heads
If you’d rather leave your bed
