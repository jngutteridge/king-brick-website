title: The Perfect Cure

Standing by the bar but you’ve had a bit too much
Waiting for a taxi but you do not want to rush
Winking at the girls but they ain’t winking back
Better watch it boy or else you’re gonna get a smack

Walking down the back street
You can’t stand on your own feet
Coming through the back door
You don’t know what you’re in for

You want it all
Can’t feel your head
Can’t feel a thing

It isn’t working any more
You thought you found that perfect cure
