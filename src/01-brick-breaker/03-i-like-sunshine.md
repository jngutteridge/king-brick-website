title: I Like Sunshine

It gets cold but it's warm inside my bed
To get help, to be well again
To see-saw, to feel lifted up a mountain
I’m looking down, my eyes are weak

The clouds they clear all the time
But they override, my bright side

I like sunshine but it’s raining in my head
If you know, could you lead me out
I don’t want, to flatten this
But I’ve stopped, it’s just pretend

I just can’t hear all the time
I can’t find the types, make up the rhymes

Scan the skies, looking for a shiny moon
Gentile light, from what I think is now
Lost in the brightness of tonight
I’m eyeless now, despite
My fondness for the sunshine

It’s too much or it’s always far too little
There’s no gap, or I have to leap to reach
But my legs, can’t stop the sprint
I keep going, I’ll never reach

I keep on wasting my time
It creeps up on me, then I die

We were walking now we’re flying
Can we leave and make this stop?
We must talk and find each other
Fight it with this tempered book

## Meaning

I love it when my moods are good. The contrast with my bad moods in other times is horrific. I want to moderate this but without dynamics I would feel nothing. Is being overjoyed worth the sacrifice if it means having to stay in bed when the sun is out?
